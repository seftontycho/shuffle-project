	Indroduction - Abstract explained, outlines structure of document
	Main Content:
		Define a deck of cards,
		Define Randomness,
		Define Shuffling
		
		Disscuss our chosen measures of good shuffling
		
		For each type of shuffle:
			Outline the shuffle,
			Discuss where it's used,
			Discuss how it compares with our measures,
			Discuss benefits and downsides to the shuffle (both numerical and skill required)
			
	Conclusion
	Appendix
	Bibliography
	



Ideas (Needs research/thought):
	Shuffles:
		Overhand,
		Riffle,
		Wash
	
	Measures:
		Total Variation Distance,
		Guessing Measure,
		5 card chunking distance
		
	Abstract concepts:
		What is a deck of cards,
		What is shuffling,
		What is randomness
		
		

	Vector Distance:
		Completely random shuffle. Graph RSS and RMS.

		Overhand -  RSS and RMS - Nice graph for 1 shuffle. Series of graphs for sucsessive shuffles.

		Riffle multiple RSS and RMS after each shuffle.

		Guessing on Riffle, Overhand and Random.

		How many cards stay the same after random shuffle.

		How many cards stay the same after riffle and overhand.

		Do some with random overlayed.

		Randomness on PC:
			Fisher Yates Shuffle
			Disscussion of code.
